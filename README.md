Papyrus is a type-safe HTTP client for Swift.

It turns your APIs into clean and concise Swift protocols.

```swift
@API
protocol GitHub {
    @GET("/users/:username/repos")
    func getRepositories(username: String) async throws -> [Repository]
}
```

```swift
let provider = Provider(baseURL: "https://api.github.com/")
let github: GitHub = GitHubAPI(provider: provider)
let repos = try await github.getRepositories(username: "alchemy-swift")
```

Each function on your protocol represents an endpoint on your API.

Annotations on the protocol, functions, and parameters help construct requests and decode responses.

```swift
@API
@Authorization(.bearer("<my-auth-token>"))
protocol Users {
    @GET("/user")
    func getUser() async throws -> User

    @URLForm
    @POST("/user")
    func createUser(email: String, password: String) async throws -> User
}
```

## Getting Started

### Requirements

Supports iOS 13+ / macOS 10.15+.

Keep in mind that Papyrus uses [macros](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/macros) which require Swift 5.9 / Xcode 15 to compile.

### Swift Concurrency

Documentation examples use [Swift concurrency](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Concurrency.html).

While using concurrency is recommended, if you haven't yet migrated and need a closure based API, see the section on [closure based APIs](#closure-based-apis).

### Alamofire & Linux drivers

Out of the box, Papyrus is powered by `URLSession`. 

If you're using Linux / Swift on Server, use the separate package [PapyrusAsyncHTTPClient](https://github.com/joshuawright11/papyrus-async-http-client). It's driven by the [swift-nio](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio) backed [async-http-client](https://github.com/swift-server/async-http-client).

### Installation

You can install Papyrus using the [Swift Package Manager](https://www.swift.org/package-manager/).

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/joshuawright11/papyrus.git", from: "0.5.2")
]
```

#### URLSession driver

Out of the box, Papyrus is powered by `URLSession`.

```swift
.product(name: "Papyrus", package: "papyrus")
```

```swift
import Papyrus
```

#### Alamofire driver

If you'd prefer to use [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire), use the `PapyrusAlamofire` library in this package.

```swift
.product(name: "PapyrusAlamofire", package: "papyrus")
```

```swift
import PapyrusAlamofire
```

#### Linux driver

If you're using Linux / Swift on Server, use the separate package [PapyrusAsyncHTTPClient](https://github.com/joshuawright11/papyrus-async-http-client). It's driven by the [swift-nio](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio) backed [async-http-client](https://github.com/swift-server/async-http-client).

## Requests

Each API you need to consume is represented by a _protocol_.

Individual endpoints are represented by the _protocol's functions_.

The function's _parameters_ and _return type_ represent the request content and response, respectively.

### Setting the Method and Path

Set the request method and path as an attribute on the function. Available methods are `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, `PUT`, `OPTIONS`, `HEAD`, `TRACE`, and `CONNECT`. Use `@Http(path:method:)` if you need a custom method.

```swift
@DELETE("/transfers/:id")
```

### Configuring the URL

The `Path` type replaces a named parameter in the path. Parameters are denoted with a leading `:`.

```swift
@GET("/users/:username/repos/:id")
func getRepository(username: Path<String>, id: Path<Int>) async throws -> [Repository]
```

Note that you don't actually need to include the `Path<...>` wrapper if the path parameter matches the function parameter. It will be inferred.

```swift
@GET("/users/:username/repos/:id")
func getRepository(username: String, id: Int) async throws -> [Repository]
```

#### Adding Query Parameters

You may set url queries with the `Query` type.

```swift
@GET("/transactions")
func getTransactions(merchant: Query<String>) async throws -> [Transaction]
```

You can also set static queries directly in the path string.

```swift
@GET("/transactions?merchant=Apple")
```

For convenience, a unattributed function parameter on a `@GET`, `@HEAD`, or `@DELETE` request is inferred to be a `Query`.

```swift
@GET("/transactions")
func getTransactions(merchant: String) async throws -> [Transaction]
```

### Headers

You can set static headers on a request using `@Headers` at the function or protocol scope.

```swift
@Headers(["Cache-Control": "max-age=86400"])
@GET("/user")
func getUser() async throws -> User
```

```swift
@API
@Headers(["X-Client-Version": "1.2.3"])
protocol Users {
    @GET("/user")
    func getUser() async throws -> User

    @PATCH("/user/:id")
    func updateUser(id: Int, name: String) async throws
}
```

For convenience, the `@Authorization` attribute can be used to set a static `"Authorization"` header.

```swift
@Authorization(.basic(username: "joshuawright11", password: "P@ssw0rd"))
protocol Users {
    ...
}
```

A variable header can be set with the `Header` type.

```swift
@GET("/accounts")
func getRepository(customHeader: Header<String>) async throws
```

Note that variable headers are automatically mapped to Capital-Kebab-Case. In this case, `Custom-Header`.

### Setting a Body

The request body can be set using `Body` on a `Codable` parameter. A function can only have one `Body` parameter.

```swift
struct Todo: Codable {
    let name: String
    let isDone: Bool
    let tags: [String]
}

@POST("/todo")
func createTodo(todo: Body<Todo>) async throws
```

Alternatively, you can set individual fields on the body `Field`. These are mutually exclusive with `Body`.

```swift
@POST("/todo")
func createTodo(name: Field<String>, isDone: Field<Bool>, tags: Field<[String]>) async throws
```

For convenience, an unattributed parameter on a request that _isn't_ a `@GET`, `@HEAD`, or `@DELETE` is inferred to be a `Field`.

```swift
@POST("/todo")
func createTodo(name: String, isDone: Bool, tags: [String]) async throws
```

### Encoding the Body

By default, all `Body` and `Field` parameters are encoded as `application/json`.

You may encode parameters as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` using `@URLForm`.

```swift
@URLForm
@POST("/todo")
func createTodo(name: String, isDone: Bool, tags: [String]) async throws
```

You can also encode parameters as `multipart/form-data` using `@Multipart`. If you do, all non-path parameter fields must be of type `Part`.

```swift
@Multipart
@POST("/attachments")
func uploadAttachments(file1: Part, file2: Part) async throws
```

You can attribute your protocol with an encoding attribute to encode all requests as such.

```swift
@API
@URLForm
protocol Todos {
    @POST("/todo")
    func createTodo(name: String, isDone: Bool, tags: [String]) async throws

    @PATCH("/todo/:id")
    func updateTodo(id: Int, name: String, isDone: Bool, tags: [String]) async throws
}
```

#### Custom Body Encoders

If you'd like to use a custom JSON or URLForm encoder, you may pass them as arguments to `@JSON` and `@URLForm`.

```swift
extension JSONEncoder {
    static var iso8601: JSONEncoder {
        let encoder = JSONEncoder()
        encoder.dateEncodingStrategy = .iso8601
        return encoder
    }
}

@JSON(encoder: .iso8601)
protocol Todos {
    ...
}
```

## Responses

The return type of your function represents the response of your endpoint.

### Decoding from the Response

Endpoint functions should return a type that conforms to `Decodable`. It will automatically be decoded from the HTTP response body using JSON by default.

```swift
@GET("/user")
func getUser() async throws -> User
```

### Empty responses

If you don't need to decode something from the response and just want to confirm it was successful, you may leave out the return type.

```swift
@DELETE("/logout")
func logout() async throws
```

Note that if the function return type is Codable or empty, any error that occurs during the request flight, such as an unsuccessful response code, will be thrown.

### Accessing the Raw Response

To just get the raw response you may set the return type to `Response`.

Note that in this case, errors that occur during the flight of the request will NOT be thrown so you should check the `Response.error` property before assuming it was successful.

```swift
@GET("/user")
func getUser() async throws -> Response

let res = try await users.getUser()
if res.error == nil {
    print("The response was successful!")
}
```

If you'd like to automatically decode a type AND access the `Response`, you may return a tuple with both.

```swift
@GET("/user")
func getUser() async throws -> (User, Response)

let (user, res) = try await users.getUser()
print("The response status code was: \(res.statusCode!)")
```

## Configuration

### Custom Keys

If you use two labels for a function parameter, the second one will be inferred as the relevant key.

```swift
@GET("/posts/:postId")
func getPost(id postId: Int) async throws -> Post
```

#### Key Mapping

Often, you'll want to encode request fields and decode response fields using something other than camelCase. Instead of setting a custom key for each individual attribute, you can use `@KeyMapping` at the function or protocol level.

Note that this affects `Query`, `Body`, and `Field` parameters on requests as well as decoding content from the `Response`.

```swift
@API
@KeyMapping(.snakeCase)
protocol Todos {
    ...
}
```

### Customizing the Generated Type

When you use `@API` or [`@Mock`](#mocking-with-mock), Papyrus will generate an implementation named `<protocol>API` or `<protocol>Mock` respectively. The [access level](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/accesscontrol/) will match the access level of the protocol.

### Alamofire

Under the hood, Papyrus uses [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) to make requests. If you'd like to use a custom Alamofire `Session` for making requests, pass it in when initializing a `Provider`.

```swift
let customSession: Session = ...
let provider = Provider(baseURL: "https://api.github.com", session: customSession)
let github: GitHub = GitHubAPI(provider: provider)
```

If needbe, you can also access the under-the-hood `Alamofire` and `URLSession` objects on a `Response`.

```swift
let response: Response = ...
let afResponse: DataResponse<Data, AFError> = response.alamofire
let urlResponse: HTTPURLResponse = response.request!
let urlRequest: URLRequest = response.response!
```

### Request Modifiers

If you'd like to manually run custom request build logic before executing any request on a provider, you may use the `modifyRequests()` function.

```swift
let provider = Provider(baseURL: "https://sandbox.plaid.com")
    .modifyRequests { (req: inout RequestBuilder) in
        req.addField("client_id", value: "<client-id>")
        req.addField("secret", value: "<secret>")
    }
let plaid: Plaid = PlaidAPI(provider: provider)
```

### Interceptors

You may also inspect a provider's raw requests and responses by using `intercept()`. Remember that you'll need to call the second closure parameter if you want the request to continue.

```swift
let provider = Provider(baseURL: "http://localhost:3000")
    .intercept { req, next in
        let start = Date()
        let res = try await next(req)
        let elapsedTime = String(format: "%.2fs", Date().timeIntervalSince(start))
        // Got a 200 for GET /users after 0.45s
        print("Got a \(res.statusCode!) for \(req.method) \(req.url!.relativePath) after \(elapsedTime)")
        return res
    }
```

If you'd like to decouple your request modifier or interceptor logic from the `Provider`, you can pass instances of the `RequestModifer` and `Interceptor` protocols on provider initialization.

```swift
let interceptor: Interceptor = ...
let modifier: Interceptor = ...
let provider = Provider(baseURL: "http://localhost:3000", modifiers: [modifier], interceptors: [interceptor])
```

### Closure Based APIs

[Swift concurrency](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Concurrency.html) is the modern way of running asynchronous code in Swift.

While using it is highly recommended, if you haven't yet migrated to Swift concurrency and need access to a closure based API, you can pass an `@escaping` completion handler as the last argument in an endpoint function.

The function must have no return type and the closure must have a single argument of type `Result<T: Codable, Error>`, `Result<Void, Error>`, or `Response` argument.

```swift
// equivalent to `func getUser() async throws -> User`
@GET("/user")
func getUser(callback: @escaping (Result<User, Error>) -> Void)

// equivalent to `func createUser(email: String, password: String) async throws`
@POST("/user")
func createUser(email: String, password: String, completion: @escaping (Result<Void, Error>) -> Void)

// equivalent to `func getResponse() async throws -> Response`
@GET("/response")
func getResponse(completion: @escaping (Response) -> Void)
```

## Testing

Because APIs defined with Papyrus are protocols, they're simple to mock in tests; just implement the protocol.

Note that the `Path`, `Header`, `Field`, and `Body` types are just typealiases for whever they wrap so you don't need to include them when conforming to the protocol.

```swift
@API
protocol GitHub {
    @GET("/users/:username/repos")
    func getRepositories(username: String, specialHeader: Header<String>) async throws -> [Repository]
}

struct GitHubMock: GitHub {
    func getRepositories(username: String, specialHeader: String) async throws -> [Repository] {
        return [
            Repository(name: "papyrus"),
            Repository(name: "alchemy")
        ]
    }
}
```

You can then use your mock during tests when the protocol is required.

```swift
struct CounterService {
    let github: GitHub

    func countRepositories(of username: String) async throws -> Int {
        try await getRepositories(username: username).count
    }
}

func testCounting() {
    let mock: GitHub = GitHubMock()
    let service = MyService(github: mock)
    let count = service.countRepositories(of: "joshuawright11")
    XCTAssertEqual(count, 2)
}
```

### Mocking with @Mock

A mock implementation can be automatically generated with the `@Mock` attribute. Like `@API`, this generates an implementation of your protocol.

A generated `Mock` type has `mock` functions to easily verify request parameters and mock their responses.

```swift
@API  // Generates `GitHubAPI: GitHub`
@Mock // Generates `GitHubMock: GitHub`
protocol GitHub {
    @GET("/users/:username/repos")
    func getRepositories(username: String) async throws -> [Repository]
}

func testCounting() {
    let mock = GitHubMock()
    mock.mockGetRepositories { username in
        XCTAssertEqual(username, "joshuawright11")
        return [
            Repository(name: "papyrus"),
            Repository(name: "alchemy")
        ]
    }

    let service = MyService(github: mock)
    let count = service.countRepositories(of: "joshuawright11")
    XCTAssertEqual(count, 2)
}
```
